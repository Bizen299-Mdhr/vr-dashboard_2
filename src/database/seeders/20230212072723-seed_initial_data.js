It was a big week for AI news as both Microsoft and Google took the stage at competing events to intro their AI developments to the public. Microsoft fared a little better with its news that OpenAI’s ChatGPT-like tech was coming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/bings-previously-unpopular-app-sees-a-10x-jump-in-downloads-after-microsofts-ai-news/">Bing, pushing its companion mobile app up into the App Store’s top ranks</a>. Meanwhile, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/google-takes-on-chatgpt-with-bard-and-shows-off-ai-in-search/">flubbed a bit with its rival AI, Bard</a>, which, in a published demonstration of the technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/google-takes-on-chatgpt-with-bard-and-shows-off-ai-in-search/">shared an incorrect answer</a> to a question about the James Webb Space Telescope (it was NOT the first to take a picture of an exoplanet, NASA says).</p><p>While both AI models will frequently and confidently get things wrong at times, Google’s failure to fact-check the answers it was showing off seemed to indicate the company was rushing out the tech in reaction to Microsoft’s move into its territory…which it was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Google should have been far ahead in this AI race, having invested in and developed AI technology for years with help from some of the top experts in the field. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/10/google-is-losing-control/">But it’s been caught off guard</a> — and not only by OpenAI.</p><p>Before this current AI race, Amazon’s Alexa became the household name for AI-powered voice assistants. Google, on the other hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/">got burned</a> when it showed off some of its more impressive consumer applications of AI. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/duplex-shows-google-failing-at-ethical-and-creative-ai-design/">It faced backlash over its consideration of AI ethics</a> when it showed off Duplex’s ability to call restaurants to book reservations while pretending to sound human. Google also often builds neat AI tools — like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/google-created-an-ai-that-can-generate-music-from-text-descriptions-but-wont-release-it/">an AI that can generate music from text descriptions —</a>&nbsp;but won’t release them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The company has seemed to be slow to move on AI — likely hesitant to upset its search and advertising cash cow that relies on ads sold atop a list of links. Microsoft doesn’t care about that, though, noting that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-chat-gpt-2-billion-revenue-search-steals-google-2023-2">every 1% of search ad share gain it makes is a $2 billion revenue opp</a>.</p><p>That’s why what we’ve gotten from Google around AI has been a sort of steady stream of smaller AI-powered feature drops over time, not some big and expensive overhaul of search that could have killed its margins.</p><p>Instead, we get things like multisearch, which expands web search to include text and images combined. Google this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/googles-a-i-powered-multisearch-which-combines-text-and-images-in-a-single-query-goes-global/">announced it was going global</a> and the nearby option, multisearch near me, was also rolling out more broadly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The company also rolled out other AI-powered improvements to things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/google-announces-improved-contextual-translation-features/">translation</a> and Google Maps. For example, Google at this week’s event <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/google-maps-immersive-view-five-cities-glanceable-directions/">spoke about its new “immersive view” maps</a> offering more true-to-life scenes, which are created by leveraging an AI technique called neural radiance fields (NeRF). But these maps are only available in a handful of cities. And as cool as they are, they feel more like an iteration on Street View rather than a major AI leap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Google used its event to show off a range of other features that weren’t AI search demos or ChatGPT rivals. It introduced Maps’ AR-powered Live View, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/google-maps-immersive-view-five-cities-glanceable-directions/">Google said is hitting a few more cities.</a> (This requires users to hold up their phones and scan the area — not really a subtle gesture if you’re trying to hide the fact that you’re a tourist or even possibly lost!) And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/google-intros-new-features-for-evs-with-maps-built-in/">it talked about new EV Maps</a>.</p><p>Microsoft, on the other hand, used its press event to fully focus on AI as the next evolution of search. It demoed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/microsoft-launches-the-new-bing-with-chatgpt-built-in/">ChatGPT-like AI in Bing</a> which is also integrated with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/microsoft-updates-its-edge-web-browser-with-built-in-a-i-capabilities/">its Edge web browser</a>. And it talked in detail about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/07/openais-next-generation-ai-model-is-behind-microsofts-new-search/">the next-gen OpenAI large language model it’s using</a>, calling it “more powerful than ChatGPT,” which certainly excited consumers.</p><p>The company also cleverly introduced a waitlist for the AI-powered Bing that required people to set Microsoft defaults on their PC and download the Bing app. As a result, the Bing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/bings-previously-unpopular-app-sees-a-10x-jump-in-downloads-after-microsofts-ai-news/">app is now ranked</a> in the top 10 on the U.S. App Store and is the No. 2 Productivity app behind Gmail. To put this in perspective, the Bing app ahead of the AI news had been ranked No. 160 on the U.S. App Store’s Productivity apps chart — in other words, practically invisible.</p><p>Google, meanwhile, lost <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/09/1155650909/google-chatbot--error-bard-shares">$100 billion in market value</a> as Alphabet’s stock fell after the ad with the AI’s mistake aired ahead of the company’s event.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the big race in AI apps is still between Google and Microsoft (via OpenAI), AI will soon find its way into a number of mobile apps through integrations. Already, we’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/10/app-store-and-play-store-are-flooded-with-dubious-chatgpt-apps/">
    seen the fake ChatGPT apps arrive</a> and belatedly 
    <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2023/01/apples-tardy-removal-of-scam-chatgpt.html">
    get the boot</a> from the app stores. Today, a search for the term “ChatGPT” still returns numerous apps that imply they’re associated with OpenAI or simply presume users won’t care, as long as they offer a ChatGPT-like experience. And we’ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/01/lensa-ai-climbs-the-app-store-charts-as-its-magic-avatars-go-viral/">AI image generators go viral</a>.&nbsp;Quora this week also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/quora-opens-its-new-ai-chatbot-app-poe-to-the-general-public/">introduced</a> an AI playground called Poe, which features a handful of AI chatbots from OpenAI and Anthropic. (See “Downloads” section below.)</p><p>Consumers are clearly hungry to see AI put to use in apps. The developments also enliven what’s become a stale App Store over the years, as Apple blocked other new tech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/25/apple-cracks-down-on-nft-functionality-social-post-boosts-with-app-store-rules/">like NFTs,</a> blockchain transactions and Web3 technologies from being fully functional on its App Store, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/magic-square-web3-app-store-apple/">forcing startups to build their own</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>An end to Apple’s ban on non-WebKit browsers?</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg 4288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=2048,1360 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=1200,797 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-887454052.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="100vw" width="4288"></figure><p><i><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some browser makers believe they’ll be able to release their own, non-WebKit-powered browser apps in the future, thanks to expected regulations that would force Apple to open up its App Store to more competition.</p><p>This week, multiple stories emerged that top browser makers like Mozilla and Google have been working on the development of non-WebKit browser apps for iOS. Google Chromium developers, for instance, have <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/03/googles_chromium_ios/">begun building an iOS browser</a> that uses Google’s Blink engine — an app that today would not be allowed on the App Store, as Apple’s guidelines specifically state that browser apps “must use the appropriate WebKit framework and WebKit Javascript.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Google, however, downplayed the news, claiming it was only a prototype meant to help it learn about iOS performance.</p><p>In a statement, a spokesperson told us, “This is an experimental prototype that we are developing as part of an open-source project with the goal to understand certain aspects of performance on iOS. It will not be available to users and we’ll continue to abide by Apple’s policies.”</p><p>Google isn’t the only one dabbling in this area. When reached for comment, Mozilla was far more transparent about its plans when it was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/mozilla_google_apple_webkit/">spotted working on a Gecko-based version</a> of Firefox for iOS, clearly indicating that its work is in anticipation of a more competitive landscape.</p><p>“We abide by Apple’s iOS app store policies, and are simply doing some exploratory work to understand the technical challenges for Gecko-based browsers on iOS if those policies were to change,” a Mozilla spokesperson told us. “We hope the day will come when people can freely decide to use the browser of their choice, including the opportunity to select the engine that underpins it.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, even if Apple were to open up to non-WebKit browsers, it could theoretically impose other limits on competing apps to dictate how they’re allowed to use system resources. That would be another reason for the companies to experiment now so they’ll be ready to meet any such requirement if and when the App Store opens up.</p><h3>Kids’ TikTok usage again tops YouTube</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GettyImages-1243334500-1-e1664195539678.jpg" alt="TikTok logo displayed on a smartphone"></figure><p><i><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto / Getty Images</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok once again found itself as the social app kids and teens are spending the most time using throughout the day, even outpacing YouTube.
